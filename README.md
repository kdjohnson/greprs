# greprs
Reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/). It has a project in which you recreate a simple version of `grep`. I simply added in highlighting of the string that it matches to. Also, the line number is printed as well.

## Usage
* `cargo run How poem.txt`
* `cargo run ";" src/lib.rs`
